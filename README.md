# IOT--Automated-Watering-System
Watering System Using IOT

This is an open source application to water plants automatically. Up to now there is almost no free professional software and instructions available to build a
DYI irrigation that is scalable, accurate and most importantly, durable. The app is also not only there to look good and for the love of data. Above all, it is 
a tool to tailor the sensors to the exact needs of the plants. This is where most irrigation systems with direct soil moisture measurement fail because every 
soil and plant is different and therefore manual calibration and possibly after some time also recalibration is essential.


The app contains the following features:

[+] Monitor and display time series data at the minute, hour, day, week and month level

[+] Setting the water level from which automatic watering should be triggered.

[+] Manual activation of irrigation with a button

[+] Switching between different sensor profiles

[+] Setting how long the pump works during an irrigation

[+] file overwrite option
